DIY Bitcoin clock for LILYGO® TTGO T-Display ESP32

## The idea for the clock
So we all know a famous clock that everyone wants to have in its hands. I don't need to name it. :)
In the end, I decided to build my clock on the cheap. You see the result below with the T-Display and a few lines of code that I played with while learning.

## Required hardware

* Display/Controller: LILYGO® TTGO T-Display ESP32
* Battery: QL902030 3.7v (or other alternative)

## Configuration

- Wireless
The board can connect to a wireless network to sync the time and data we need for the clock.

## To-Do
- [ ] Use better display positioning for the text
- [ ] Connect and Disconnect Wi-Fi only to update readings to preserve battery life
- [ ] Find a better source for reading data from (currently Binance)
- [ ] Add block height info to the display
- [ ] Switch screens with the buttons (still not sure if possible at all)
